# NKI Dataset

This folder re-distributes data extracted from the breastCancerNKI R package under the same Artistic-2.0 License. The dataset was converted to three csv files containing the
measurements along with observation and feature metadata. The breastCancerNKI R package can be install with [bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/breastCancerNKI.html) but is not required to reproduce our work.
